# Road_Accident_Analysis
A small project from the first semester

SUMMARY
==========================================================================================

In the zip-folder you will find the PDF-File with the Analysis of road accidents in
Switzerland from 2011 to 2020. The Analysis is done using the Programming Language R.

Furthermore the zip-folder cotains all the data required for the analysis. It is including
the main csv-file "RoadTrafficAccidentLocations.csv" from the Bundesamt f√ºr Strassen
ASTRA. Furthermore the excel-file "PopulationCH.xlsx" containing the population
information for each canton of Switzerland. The excel-file "Axa.xslx" is a fictive 
file containing fictional data. And the the LV03 Coordinates of the Cantons in the txt file
"LV03_Cantons.txt" for a geographic map of Switzerland added by the G1K09.shp in the seperate 
folder file_maps_CH.


USAGE 
==========================================================================================

To run the analysis it is recommended to extract the zip-folder and store all the data in
a place of your choice. In R-Studio you need to refer to the folder "data" where all
the needed data is stored. Therefore setwd () to your folder where you extracted the data 
in the zip file.
